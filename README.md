**Task 01 : The relative cases overtime of Covid infectors (absolut Covid cases/population size)**

Folder Task01 contains .pynb file which takes the time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv file for the infected people data set from all the countries.
I have considered India, China and Germany for the dataset and presented their data as explained in the lecture.

**Task 02 : The vaccination rate (percentage of the population) over time **

Folder Task 02 contains .ipynb file which takes the VaccinationsData.csv for the vaccinated people dataset from all over the world. I have presented multiple
trends. I have shown the overall status of vaccinated people , vaccination progress comparision in India, China and Germany. I have also tried for showing
the world vaccinated percentage but due to large data set I have limited to some records.
