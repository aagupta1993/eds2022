**Task 01 : The relative cases overtime of Covid infectors (absolut Covid cases/population size)**

Folder Task01 contains .pynb file which takes the dataset from the URL provided for the infected people data set from all the countries.
I have considered Albania, Spain and Greece for the dataset and presented their data as explained in the lecture.

_**Source of Dataset:**_

https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv

**Task 02 : The vaccination rate (percentage of the population) over time**

Folder Task02 contains .ipynb file which takes the dataset from the URL provided for the vaccinated people dataset from all over the world. 
I have considered same countries that is Albania, Spain and Greece for the vaccinate rate plot.

_**Source of Dataset:**_

**Task03 : Dynamic dashboard for COVID-19 **

Folder Task03 contains .ipynb file which takes the dataset directly from URL (in raw format) for the infected people. It transforms the data into the required format in COVID_final_set.csv which is the final data set used for dashboard. 
It provides the dashboard with an option to select country and the possible measures like doubling rate and confirmed rate.

 **Task04: Dynamic dashboard for SIR curve **
 
 Folder Task04 contains .ipynb file which takes the dataset directly from URL in raw format for the infected and recovery data. It transforms the data into the required format in COVID_small_flat_table.csv which is the final data set used for dashboard.
It provides the dashboard to provide a SIR view selection by countries which can be modified in the code in country_list .
